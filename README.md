# Classifier

My plan is to create a custom fine-tuned classification model with dataset potentially found from Kaggle. 

Here is the tech stack:
- pytorch - for underlying deeplearning framework
- transformers - to get llms, interact with them, etc. 
- datasets - this library will be used to load and transform the data
